**COVID-19 Data Analysis Project**

**Introduction:**
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data including confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook with the Pandas library for data manipulation and visualization. Two main datasets are used: one containing COVID-19 statistics and the other containing vaccination details.

**Data Sources:**
covid_19_india: This dataset provides information about confirmed cases, deaths, and other related metrics for different states or regions.
covid_vaccine_statewise: This dataset includes details about the COVID-19 vaccinations administered, categorized by states or regions.

**Project Goals:**
Analyze the trend of COVID-19 cases over time.
Explore the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across different states or regions.
Investigate the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations and their coverage across different states or regions.

**Project Structure:**

Data Cleaning and Preparation: The datasets are loaded into Jupyter Notebook, and initial data cleaning steps are performed. This involves handling missing values, data type conversions, and restructuring the data if necessary.

Feature Engineering: New features may be created to facilitate analysis, such as calculating vaccination rates or deriving additional metrics from existing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations, including line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps, are generated to explore the trends and relationships within the data. EDA helps in understanding the distributions, correlations, and patterns present in the datasets.
